# Dealing with git conflicts
```
nano best-books.md 

git add .

git commit -m "maggie's book"

git push

git remote add upstream https://github.com/crsl4/phylo-class-social
```

This will produce errors:
```
git pull upstream master
```

To fix it, change the file however you want it to look using nano. Then repeat:

```
nano best-books.md 

git add .

git commit -m "maggie's book"

git push
```
THEN, go to github website and request pull from your own account

Can use this to go back to before you made a change if you haven't done git add:
```
git checkout --
```

# Basics of Git
Look at git config
```
git config -v
```

See what git channels you are connected to:
```
git remote -v
```

If upstream channel is not the one you expect (in our case /crsl4/phylo-class-social), use this to change:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/crsl4/phylo-class-social
```

# Reproducibility Homework Part 3
On Github website, fork from [here](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/class-repos.md)

Now git clone your forked repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mlangwig/phylogenetics-class.git
```

See that you are currently linked to your own repos:
```
margueritelangwig@Marguerites-MacBook-Pro phylogenetics-class % git remote -v         
origin	https://github.com/mlangwig/phylogenetics-class.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/mlangwig/phylogenetics-class.git (push)
```

So we want to add the original repo upstream to be able to push to it:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class
```

Now check:
```
margueritelangwig@Marguerites-MacBook-Pro phylogenetics-class % git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/mlangwig/phylogenetics-class.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/mlangwig/phylogenetics-class.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class (push)
```

Nano exercises/class-repos.md, add your link, then:
```
git add .

git commit -m "maggie's github link"

git push
```

Now go to the Github website, go to the file that you changed in your forked git repo, click Pull Requests in the top left corner, New pull request (this should show you the changes you made in the file), and then Create pull request
